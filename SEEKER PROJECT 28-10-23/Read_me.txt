Concept behind Seeker is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your location like many popular location based websites.
Seeker Hosts a fake website which asks for Location Permission and if the target allows it, we can get:
  
Longitude
Latitude
Accuracy
Altitude - Not always available
Direction - Only available if user is moving
Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get Device Information without any permissions :

Unique ID using Canvas Fingerprinting
Device Model - Not always available
Operating System
Platform
Number of CPU Cores - Approximate Results
Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
Screen Resolution
GPU information
Browser Name and Version
Public IP Address
Local IP Address
Local Port
Automatic IP Address Reconnaissance is performed after the above information is received.

This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.
